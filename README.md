- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, we are @tamuwicys

WiCyS is a community dedicated to the engagement, encouragement, and support of women in cybersecurity. As a national organization, WiCyS brings together women from academia, research, and industry to share knowledge, experience, and opportunities for networking and mentoring.

At Texas A&M University, College Station, our WiCyS chapter is committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive environment. We welcome new members and encourage you to join our events, connect with us at meetings, and become part of our vibrant community.
